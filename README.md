# CLPS-Project-1
Traffic Violation Bias

This project analyzes the bias which police hold and act upon in Montgomery County, Maryland. First, we show the bias in a police officer's decision to pull over a driver in the first place. This data finds that certain racial groups and certain genders were pulled over at disparate rates.
We also illustrate that intersections between racial identity, sex, and time of day influence the outcome (whether or not a driver recieves a citation or a warning) of a car pull-over. 
An interesting point to note is that racial categories and sex categories are assigned to individuals by the police officer -- for example, drivers labelled "Hispanic" are *racialized* as "Hispanic" by the police officer themselves. Given this example, drivers who are not visually profiled as "Hispanic" racially (despite Hispanic being an ethnic group) could still identify as Hispanic. Race, particularly, is not inherent to an individual, but *assigned*.  !

This plot shows the relationship between the indentities of a hispanic male, hispanic female, white male, and white female and how predictive these identities are on whether a citation was given or not. The graph shows that out of these identities hispanic males were the most predictive followed by hispanic females, white males, then white females.

This plot shows the relationship between the indentities of a black male, black female, asian male, and asian female and how predictive these identities are on whether a citation was given or not.

The graph shows that out of these identities black male is the most predictive, then a black female, then a white male, and the least is a white female (code can be found under file Haleyplotting.m).

This plot shows the relationship between the indentities of a asian male, asian female, white male, and white female and how predictive these identities are on whether a citation was given or not. The graph shows that out of these identities white and asian males are the best predictors(with white males being slightly better), and white and asian females falling slightly below.
